## Py Tic Tac Toe

______________________________________________________________________

This program was written by Russell Lamb Sep 28 2016 

The game was created as an exercise in using python to process user input and codify rules to achieve a given effect

There are several text files in the repository with a list of moves to test given outcomes.  

These test files can be piped into standard input to simulate the entire move set.  

For example, to simulate X winning via a diagonal:
python tictactoe.py < xdiag1.txt

Ideas for future versions:  
1. update grpahical interface  
2. create AI to play as player "O"  
3. Make interface point and click instead of text based.
